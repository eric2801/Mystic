# Mystic

Estimation of an old Windows screen saver. I have always liked this screen saver
on Windows, so I wrote this similar version for macOS.

## Build & Installation

- Open the project in Xcode
- Select `My Mac` as the target
- Create an Archive and Distribute the Built Products
- Copy the `Mystic.saver` file to `~/Library/Screen Savers`

The screen saver should now be selectable in System Preferences.
